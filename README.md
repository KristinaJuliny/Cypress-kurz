E-shop Sample Project

This project is designed for testing, learning, and mentoring purposes. It offers an initial glimpse into the real test development process. The project consists of a Front-end part developed in Angular and a Back-end part created in Node.js, with databases stored as JSON files where you can view data immediately.

Our objective is to teach you how real web testing operates. How will we achieve this? Throughout the project, we will cover the basics of web development, including page processes and structures. We'll also delve into HTML and CSS fundamentals to provide comprehensive knowledge for upcoming lessons. You'll learn about package.json, basic terminal commands, and introductory Git usage. We'll begin by installing Cypress and configuring it, exploring its structure, and executing basic commands such as cy.visit, get, should, click, select, contain, clear, wait, and reload. We'll also cover Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its setup, establish database connections, and tackle advanced Cypress commands like intercept, using cy.task, cookies, local storage, and session handling. We'll automate scenarios such as handling cookie banners to avoid them, logging in, and saving sessions, as well as adjusting timeout settings.
